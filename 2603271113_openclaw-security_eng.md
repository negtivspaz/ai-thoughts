# OpenClaw Security Risks: A Warning to Users and Self-Hosters

![secImg](../../../assets/images/2603271113_openclaw-security.png)

OpenClaw 🦞 is powerful, but it currently carries serious security risk when self-hosted with default settings. Community reports and security discussions consistently point to exposed services, untrusted community skills, and weak operational guardrails.

This guide explains:

- what is risky
- how attackers typically abuse it
- the minimum hardening steps you should apply today

**Key takeaways**
- Many instances expose default ports (`18789`, `8000`) publicly
- Community skills can function as a supply-chain attack vector
- Safe deployment requires isolation, strict allowlisting, and continuous monitoring

## Why OpenClaw Is High Risk

OpenClaw agents can execute powerful actions on the host. That design is useful for automation, but dangerous when combined with unvetted third-party skills and internet-exposed control surfaces.

The two biggest risk multipliers are:

1. **Publicly exposed services**  
   If gateway/API ports are reachable from the internet, attackers can scan, probe, and in some cases execute workflows or abuse control channels.

2. **Untrusted skills**  
   Skills sourced from public hubs may include obfuscated or malicious behavior (credential theft, command downloaders, exfiltration logic). Even when removed, variants can reappear.

Treat OpenClaw as you would any high-privilege remote execution system: assume compromise is possible unless strict controls are in place.

## Common Attack Patterns

Recent community incident reports show recurring patterns:

- Exfiltration of API keys, tokens, host metadata, or config files
- Skills using hidden outbound calls (webhooks, HTTP POST, encoded payloads)
- Port exposure on default binds (`0.0.0.0`) with weak access controls
- Re-uploaded malicious skill variants with minor changes

In practice, compromise often starts with either a malicious skill install or an exposed management endpoint.

## Real Incidents and Attack Chains

- **ClawHub Malicious Activity (January-February 2026)**  
  Dozens to hundreds of skills were reported with malicious payload patterns, including encoded obfuscation, fake dependencies, and unencrypted HTTP exfiltration.

  ```bash
  # Clone skills repo for audit
  git clone https://github.com/openclaw/skills ~/openclaw-skills
  cd ~/openclaw-skills

  # Grep for common malicious patterns (exfil, downloads, encoding)
  grep -r -i "curl.*http\|wget.*http\|base64\|powershell\|cmd.exe\|keylog" . --include="*.json" --include="*.yaml"

  # Check for non-HTTPS endpoints
  grep -r -i "http://" . | grep -v "https"

  # Remove suspicious skills. Be careful of this rm command
  find . -name "*research*" -o -name "*hsk*" | xargs rm -rf

  # Reinstall clean: backup first
  cp -r ~/openclaw-skills ~/openclaw-skills.bak
  ```

- **Moltbook Leak Case (February 2026)**  
  A widely shared report described config/API key exfiltration behavior via webhook-like outbound channels.

  ```bash
  # Scan local OpenClaw logs for exfil (Discord, external APIs)
  sudo journalctl -u openclaw | grep -i "discord\|webhook\|http.*post" | tail -20

  # Check running processes for anomalies
  ps aux | grep openclaw | grep -E "curl|wget|nc"
  kill -9 <PID>  # Kill suspect process

  # Inspect config for leaks
  grep -r "api_key\|token\|webhook" ~/.openclaw/config.yaml
  ```

- **Port Exposure and Remote Execution (Persistent Issue)**  
  Publicly exposed defaults continue to be one of the most common root causes.

  ```bash
  # On Ubuntu/Debian (Linux)
  sudo netstat -tuln | grep 8000  # Confirm exposure
  sudo ufw deny 8000  # Block port
  sudo systemctl restart openclaw

  # macOS (use pfctl or firewall)
  sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf  # Edit to block 8000/tcp
  sudo pfctl -E
  ```

## Practical Hardening Plan

Use this in order. Do not skip Tier 1.

### Tier 1 (Required): Lock Down the Host

- Disable password-based SSH and root SSH login
- Set host firewall to default deny inbound
- Allow SSH only from trusted IPs
- Bind all OpenClaw services to loopback
- Remove or disable unused tools/integrations

```bash
# Disable root SSH, enforce keys (Linux)
sudo sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd

# Install fail2ban/UFW
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ufw fail2ban -y
sudo ufw enable; sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow ssh  # From your IP only: sudo ufw allow from <YOUR_IP> to any port 22
```

### Tier 2 (Strongly Recommended): Isolate Runtime

- Run OpenClaw in a dedicated container or VM
- Keep network access minimal (prefer private-only connectivity)
- Mount only required volumes; use read-only mounts where possible
- Never run with host root privileges unless absolutely required

```bash
# Pull official image (verify tag)
docker pull openclaw/openclaw:latest

# Run isolated (no ports, minimal volumes)
docker run -d --name secure-claw \
  --network none \  # No network access
  -v /path/to/safe/config:/config:ro \
  -v /tmp/claw-data:/data \
  openclaw/openclaw:latest

# Inspect container
docker logs secure-claw | grep -i "skill\|load"
docker exec secure-claw ps aux  # Check processes
```

### Tier 3 (Advanced): Zero-Trust Operations

- Require VPN/Tailscale/SSH tunnel for remote access
- Keep OpenClaw off the public internet entirely
- Enforce a strict skill allowlist
- Monitor outbound network traffic and process execution
- Rotate credentials regularly and after any suspicious event

```bash
# Tailscale VPN (no public ports)
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up --authkey=<your-key>

# Whitelist skills
nano ~/.openclaw/allowlist.yaml  # Only vetted: - safe-skill-1
openclaw --config ~/.openclaw/config.yaml --skills allowlist.yaml

# Audit runtime
sudo strace -p $(pgrep openclaw) -e trace=execve  # Trace execs
```

## Ports 18789/8000: What To Do

Do not expose OpenClaw gateway/API ports directly to the internet.

Set components to loopback-only:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.bind "loopback"
openclaw config set vector.bind "loopback"
openclaw config set frontend.bind "loopback"
```

Then verify:

```bash
openclaw config get gateway.bind
openclaw gateway status
sudo netstat -tuln | grep -E "18789|8000|3000"
```

If remote access is needed, use SSH port forwarding or a private mesh VPN (for example, Tailscale), not direct port exposure.

## Incident Response (If You Suspect Compromise)

1. Isolate the host from external networks
2. Disable OpenClaw services and revoke exposed credentials
3. Remove untrusted skills and redeploy from a known-good baseline
4. Review logs for suspicious outbound traffic and process execution
5. Rotate all API keys, tokens, and secrets

If you cannot verify integrity, rebuild the environment from scratch.

## Safer Alternatives

If you need stronger auditability and lower operational risk:

- Prefer managed platforms with enterprise controls
- Use local frameworks only with sandboxing and strict policy controls
- Avoid community extensions unless they are audited and pinned

OpenClaw can still be useful, but only when operated with a security-first setup. The default convenience path is not a safe path.
